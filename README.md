# OOP-Project

This project is a simple interactive console application implemented in TypeScript. It includes two classes: Person and Student, which demonstrate basic object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance and encapsulation.

The Person class represents a generic person with a personality attribute.
The Student class extends the Person class and adds a name attribute.
The application uses the Inquirer.js library to prompt the user for their name and a choice between talking to themselves or another person. Based on the user's choice, it sets the personality attribute of the student and displays the result.

**Features:**

- Object-oriented programming demonstration
- Interactive console prompts using Inquirer.js
- Inheritance and encapsulation examples
